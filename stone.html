        <p style="text-align: center;">We are in a forest near another forest near a lake. The lake is big, with a little river. There are some mushrooms near it. There is also a bear (we think). The trees look like normal trees, not those weird trees (with those flying things in). There is also a cave, somewhere. And a rabbit (but we killed and ate him). For star navigation; follow the star near the star thats not near a lot of stars but quite near another big star. And then when you come to a river, follow the lake into a forest and then find a tree that looks like a tree (it's near a red bush). We are somewhere near that.</p>
